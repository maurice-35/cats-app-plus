#  Approach
I started by signing up to the [thecatapi.com](https://thecatapi.com/) API and receiving an API key.

### Wireframe
I made a short plan using Figma.com as shown below.

#  Process
I started by installing the necessary packages and frameworks then, I set up the `App.js page`. I then requested the data from the API and made sure I was receiving this on the console in the developer tool.

I created the `navigation page` and the cats folder. I created the index page and styled apprioriately. I displayed the data from the API on the app as seen below.

#  Wins
- It was a good way to exercise my technical skills.
#  Challenges
I could not display images from the cat IDs so I set up the props on the same index page.
#  Future Features
This final output does not cover all my intentions and plans for the project. As a result, I intend to make some improvements on this project particularly on:
- Creating a CatShow page displaying the images and data from the API.
